## Who am I

Hi, I'm Xia Luo(in English), I am an undergraduate majoring in computer science and technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University. I will graduate from the summer of 2019. 

I love programming which I believe can change the world. I enjoy the feeling I click at the keyboard, when I solve one problem after another, I have a strong sense of accomplishment in mind. I'm interested in technology in many directions, such as Web FE/BE, 3D graphics, web safety, database, native Applications and so on. I'm devoted in Web development. I use several Programing language: JavaScript/Node.js, Haskell, C/C++ and Python, most of them is JavaScript/Node.js. I love Functional Programming style.
